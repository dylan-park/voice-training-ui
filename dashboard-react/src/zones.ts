// Resonance (formants F2 & F3) — the brightness / vocal-tract-size cue.
//
// MEASURE: vowel-targeted **median** F2/F3 over loud, stable vowel nuclei (not
// the old all-frames mean) — see the WASM analyzer vowel formant gating.
//
// REFERENCE-GROUNDED on **VCTK American speakers** (single consistent corpus,
// measured with the SAME method): n = 17 female, 4 male.
//   F2: FEMALE mean 1450 Hz (1280…1646) · MALE mean 1281 Hz (1234…1325)
//   F3: FEMALE mean 2742 Hz (2403…3049) · MALE mean 2523 Hz (2365…2695)
//
// F2 separates the sexes (~169 Hz, female higher); F3 less so (~219 Hz, heavy
// overlap) — real-but-imperfect cues, not hard lines. Bands are set so each
// sex's MEAN lands in its zone (female → FEM, male → MASC) with the overlap as
// the neutral band. Caveats: small male n (4); the user reads the Rainbow
// Passage while refs read other sentences, so median formants stay somewhat
// content-dependent — guidance, not law.
//
// COLOR RULE (strict): blue MASC = deeper/masculine (LOWER) ONLY; pink FEM =
// brighter/feminine (HIGHER); butter = the overlap between.

// Vocal weight via **corrected H1*–A3*** (Iseli–Alwan 2007 source spectral tilt,

// the vocal-tract filter — the formant-correction step removes resonance, which
// is what the old alpha ratio was accidentally re-measuring. NOTE the direction
// FLIPPED vs the old alpha ratio: a SMALLER value = steeper source roll-off =
// LIGHTER (feminine); a LARGER value = flatter source = HEAVIER (masculine). So
// the FEM band is now the LOW end, MASC the HIGH end.
//
// REFERENCE-GROUNDED on **VCTK American** (n = 17 female, 4 male):

// lighter. Direction: lower = lighter/feminine.

// and the M/F ranges overlap heavily (plenty of women reach into the "heavy"
// range); a separate mixed-corpus sample showed almost NO separation at all. So
// treat the M/F bands as loose orientation only — weight is best read as **your
// OWN change over time across your samples**, not a vs-other-people verdict. The
// `note.weight` slot says this to the user. Only the direction (lower = lighter)
